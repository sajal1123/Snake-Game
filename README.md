# snake_game
A classic game we all love to play! You control a snake as he makes his way through obstacles to eat as much food as possible.

The rules of the game are simple:
1. You grow by 1 block when you eat a red block.
2. A number of additional yellow blocks will emerge each time you consume a red block.
3. Hitting a yellow block results in instant death.
4. You control the direction of the snake's movement.

Good Luck!

P.S.
I got the idea to make this version thanks to Al Sweigart(al@inventwithpython.com). I also used snippets of his code from the game found here: http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter6.html#
